# LaTeX Installation Helper - Feature Complete ✅

## Overview

Users can now install LaTeX directly from the app with a single click, without leaving the application.

## What Was Added

### 1. LaTeX Installation Helper Module
**File:** `src/latex-installer.js`

Features:
- ✅ Detects OS (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- ✅ Provides platform-specific installation info
- ✅ Offers one-click installation for macOS
- ✅ Shows helpful instructions for all platforms
- ✅ Runs installation in background (non-blocking)

### 2. IPC Handler in Main Process
**File:** `src/main.js` (line 700+)

- ✅ `app:installLatex` handler exposed
- ✅ Shows native dialog with installation options
- ✅ Supports background installation on macOS
- ✅ Provides links for Windows/Linux users

### 3. API Exposure in Preload
**File:** `src/preload.js` (line 54+)

- ✅ `window.api.installLatex()` now available
- ✅ Accessible from renderer process

### 4. Installation Prompt UI
**File:** `src/renderer/app.js` (line 26610+)

- ✅ Toast notification appears when LaTeX export attempted without LaTeX
- ✅ "Install" button triggers installation dialog
- ✅ Non-intrusive (auto-dismisses after 10 seconds)
- ✅ Prevents spam (won't show again within 30 seconds)
- ✅ Uses smooth animation (slides in from right)

### 5. Enhanced Export Logic
**File:** `src/renderer/app.js` (line 26540+)

- ✅ Detects LaTeX not installed error
- ✅ Shows helpful message

## How It Works

### Flow When User Tries to Export LaTeX PDF (No LaTeX Installed)

```
User exports LaTeX file to PDF
         ↓
App checks: Is LaTeX installed? → NO
         ↓
Error detected: "LaTeX not installed"
         ↓
Status message shown: "LaTeX is not installed..."
         ↓
Toast notification appears: "LaTeX not installed. Enable LaTeX PDF export."
                            [Install button]
         ↓
User clicks "Install" (optional)
         ↓
Native dialog shows:
  • Title: "LaTeX Installation"
  • Message: "This will install MacTeX (minimal version, ~2GB)"
  • Buttons: [Install in Background] [Cancel]
         ↓
User clicks "Install in Background"
         ↓
Installation starts (runs in background)
         ↓
Message: "LaTeX is being installed in the background...
          This may take 10-30 minutes. You can continue using the app.
          Once complete, restart the app to use LaTeX export."
         ↓
App continues working while installation runs
         ↓
After installation completes:
  • User restarts app
  • LaTeX is detected
  • Native TeX PDF export is used for future exports
```

## Platform-Specific Behavior

### macOS
✅ **One-Click Installation**
```
User sees: [Install in Background] button
     ↓
Runs: brew install mactex-no-gui
     ↓
~2GB minimal MacTeX installation
     ↓
Takes 10-30 minutes
```

**Why minimal version?**
- Full MacTeX: ~4GB
- Minimal (mactex-no-gui): ~2GB
- Contains all LaTeX essentials for PDF compilation
- No GUI tools, just the compiler

### Linux
✅ **Manual Installation (Fedora/Debian)**
```
User sees: [Learn More] button
     ↓
Shows instructions:
  "For Ubuntu/Debian:
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install texlive-latex-base..."
     ↓
User runs commands in terminal
```

**Why manual?**
- Can't run `sudo` without terminal interaction
- App can't elevate privileges automatically
- But provides exact commands to copy-paste

### Windows
✅ **External Link**
```
User sees: [Learn More] button
     ↓
Opens: https://miktex.org/download
     ↓
User downloads and installs MiKTeX GUI
     ↓
User restarts app
```

**Why external?**
- Windows installers are executables
- App can't run without user interaction
- MiKTeX installer is user-friendly

## Installation Details

### macOS Background Installation

The `latex-installer.js` runs the installation in background using:

```javascript
const child = spawn('bash', ['-c', command], {
  stdio: 'pipe', // Don't show terminal
  detached: true
});
child.unref(); // Allow app to exit even if install running
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ App doesn't freeze
- ✅ User can continue working
- ✅ App can be closed (install continues)
- ✅ Logs installation completion

### Status Feedback

User sees:
1. **First message** (immediate): "LaTeX is not installed..."
2. **Toast notification** (optional click): "LaTeX not installed. [Install]"
3. **Dialog** (after clicking Install): "This will install MacTeX..."
4. **Final message** (after confirmation): "LaTeX is being installed in the background..."

---

## Code Structure

### latex-installer.js
```javascript
getLatexInstallationInfo()        // Detect OS and LaTeX status
showInstallationDialog()          // Show installation dialog
attemptAutoInstall()              // Run installation
runInstallationInBackground()     // Run without blocking
```

### main.js Integration
```javascript
// Line 700: IPC handler
ipcMain.handle('app:installLatex', async (_event) => {
  const result = await showInstallationDialog(win);
  return result;
});
```

### preload.js Exposure
```javascript
// Line 54: API exposure
installLatex: () => ipcRenderer.invoke('app:installLatex'),
```

### app.js Toast Notification
```javascript
function showInstallationPrompt() {
  // Creates toast notification with Install button
  // Prevents spam (30-second cooldown)
  // Auto-dismisses after 10 seconds
}
```

## User Experience

### Scenario 1: User Doesn't Install
```
1. Try to export LaTeX file
2. See "LaTeX not installed" message
3. Toast notification appears for 10 seconds
4. Dismiss or ignore
5. PDF exports using HTML renderer
6. User can still access LaTeX export next time
```

### Scenario 2: User Installs (macOS)
```
1. Try to export LaTeX file
2. See installation prompt
3. Click "Install in Background"
4. Installation starts (~20 minutes)
5. User continues working
6. After restart, LaTeX PDF export works
```

### Scenario 3: User Installs Later
```
1. Use HTML export for a while
2. Later, decide to install LaTeX
3. Click File menu or try export again
4. Trigger installation
5. After restart, use LaTeX export
```

## Messages Shown

### Status Message (When Export Attempted)
```
"LaTeX is not installed. To enable PDF export with LaTeX compilation:

macOS: brew install mactex-no-gui
or visit: https://www.tug.org/mactex/

PDF export will use HTML fallback until LaTeX is installed."
```

### Toast Notification
```
[INFO ICON] LaTeX not installed. Enable LaTeX PDF export. [Install]
```

### Installation Dialog
```
Title: LaTeX Installation
Message: This will install MacTeX (minimal version, ~2GB)
Detail: This may take 10-30 minutes depending on your internet speed.
        The app will continue to work while installing.
Buttons: [Install in Background] [Cancel]
```

### Success Message
```
"LaTeX is being installed in the background...

This may take 10-30 minutes. You can continue using the app.
Once complete, restart the app to use LaTeX export."
```

## Technical Details

### Minimal MacTeX Installation
- Size: ~2GB (vs full MacTeX ~4GB)
- Contents: pdflatex, xelatex, core packages
- Installation: `brew install mactex-no-gui`
- Missing: GUI tools, some optional packages
- Sufficient for: 99% of LaTeX documents

### Why Not Bundle LaTeX?
1. **Size**: Full LaTeX is 4+ GB
   - App would be 4+ GB instead of ~200 MB
   - Impractical for distribution
   - Slow downloads

2. **Licensing**: LaTeX has multiple licenses
   - Easier to let users install directly
   - Complies with all licenses

3. **Updates**: LaTeX is frequently updated
   - Easier for users to update independently
   - Packages change regularly

4. **Platform Support**: Different on each OS
   - macOS: brew, MacTeX, etc.
   - Linux: apt, dnf, TeX Live, etc.
   - Windows: MiKTeX, TeX Live, etc.
