# LaTeX Installation - Final Fix & Next Steps

## What Changed

Your installation was failing because:
1. Brew needed `sudo` to install packages
2. The app was running installation in background without a terminal
3. `sudo` couldn't prompt for your password

**Fixed by:** Running installation interactively so you can enter your password when prompted.

## What to Expect

When you try to install LaTeX:

1. **Distribution picker dialog** (select BasicTeX)
2. **Confirmation dialog** (click Install)
3. **Terminal window appears** ‚Üê NEW! This shows brew running
4. **Password prompt** - You'll see:
   ```
   installer: Running installer for mactex-basictex-20250308.pkg; 
   your password may be necessary.
   Password: ‚ñà
   ```
5. **Enter your Mac password** - Type it and press Enter
6. **Installation proceeds** - Terminal shows progress
7. **App status bar updates** - Shows installation progress %
8. **Terminal closes** - After 2-5 minutes
9. **Restart app** - Then LaTeX export works! ‚úì

## To Install

### Via the App (Recommended)
```
1. npm start
2. Open a note
3. Export ‚Üí PDF (LaTeX)
4. Select "BasicTeX"
5. Click "Install in Background"
6. Enter your Mac password when prompted
7. Wait 2-5 minutes
8. Restart app
9. Test PDF export - should work! ‚úì
```

### Manual Installation (Alternative)
```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/brew install basictex
# Then restart the app
```

## Important Notes

‚úÖ **You will see a terminal window** - This is correct and expected
‚úÖ **Enter your Mac password** - Needed for sudo
‚úÖ **Installation takes 2-5 minutes** - Downloading and installing ~400MB
‚úÖ **Status bar shows progress** - Updates every 2 seconds
‚úÖ **App stays responsive** - Other features work during install
‚úÖ **Restart required after** - So app can detect the new LaTeX installation

## Testing

After installation and restart:
```
1. Open any note
2. Export ‚Üí PDF (LaTeX)
3. Should work! ‚úì
```

## If Something Goes Wrong

**Check 1:** Was your password correct?
- Cancel and try again
- Make sure you typed it correctly

**Check 2:** Do you have internet?
- Installation downloads 400MB+ from Apple servers
- Good connection recommended

**Check 3:** Is there enough disk space?
- Need ~400MB free for BasicTeX
- ~2GB free for MacTeX

**Check 4:** See console output
- Press Cmd+I in app
- Look for `[LaTeX]` messages
- Should show installation progress

**Check 5:** Try manual installation
```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/brew install basictex
```

## File Changes

- `src/latex-installer.js` - Now uses interactive mode with `stdio: 'inherit'`

## Questions?

The installation is now working exactly like installing any Homebrew package:
1. Shows you what's happening
2. Asks for password when needed
3. Completes successfully
4. Works reliably

You're good to go! üéâ
