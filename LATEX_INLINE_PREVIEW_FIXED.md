# LaTeX Inline Commands - Now Working! ✅

## Quick Fix Summary

The issue was that `&table` and `&figure` commands were calling the Markdown preview renderer instead of the LaTeX preview renderer in `.tex` files.

## What Changed

### 1. **Table Preview** - FIXED ✅
```
Type: &table 3x4
In .tex file → renders as LaTeX tabular
In preview → shows as HTML table with borders
```

### 2. **Figure Preview** - FIXED ✅
```
Type: &figure myimage.png
In .tex file → renders as LaTeX figure environment
In preview → shows as styled figure with caption
```

### 3. **Code Preview** - ENHANCED ✅
```
Type: &code python
In .tex file → renders as LaTeX lstlisting
In preview → shows as formatted code block with language highlighting
```

## How It Works Now

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| User types `&table 4x4` | Command inserts LaTeX tabular syntax |
| Editor saves | Content saved with LaTeX markup |
| Live preview updates | **renderLatexPreview() is called** (was: renderMarkdownPreview) |
| LaTeX processor | Converts `\begin{tabular}` → `<table>` HTML |
| Browser displays | Formatted table with CSS styling |

3. → See table in both editor AND live preview!
4. Type: `&figure demo.png`
5. → See figure in both editor AND live preview!
6. Type: `&code python`
7. → See code block in both editor AND live preview!

## Technical Details

**Modified files:**
- `src/renderer/app.js` (3 key changes)

**Key functions updated:**
