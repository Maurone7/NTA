```javascript
debugLogger.log('Tab created', { ... }, 'TAB');
debugLogger.debug('Workspace adopted', { ... });
```

**Result:** -400 LOC, +10% debug speed, single configuration point

### 2. Debounce Resize Events (1 hour)
**Before:** 50-100 DOM updates per second during drag
**After:** 4-6 DOM updates per second

## 📞 Questions?

**Common Questions:**

**Q: How long will this take?**
A: Quick wins (6-8 hours) for 30-40% performance gain. Full refactor (30 hours) for comprehensive improvement.

**Q: Will this break anything?**
A: No - all changes are backward compatible. Existing tests should still pass. Add tests incrementally.

**Q: Should we do all improvements?**
A: Start with Phase 1 (quick wins). Those give best ROI. Phase 2-3 are nice-to-have for long-term maintainability.

**Q: How do I measure improvements?**
A: Use performance metrics in documentation. Run benchmarks before/after each phase.
