# Complete Save Functionality Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Critical Issue #1: IPC Handler Was a No-Op
**File:** `src/main.js` line 315
- The `workspace:saveExternalMarkdown` handler was set to `noopAsync` (does nothing)
- This meant files were never actually written to disk
- **Fixed:** Implemented proper handler that calls `folderManager.saveMarkdownFile()`

### Critical Issue #2: persistNotes() Only Saved Markdown
**File:** `src/renderer/app.js` line 11155
- Filter only included `note.type === 'markdown'`
- Other file types (code, text, latex, html) were never saved
- **Fixed:** Updated filter to include all editable types

### Critical Issue #3: Code/Text Files Not in Editor
**File:** `src/renderer/app.js` line 10925
- Code and text files were only shown in preview, not in editable textarea
- Changes couldn't be captured from files that weren't editable in the UI
- **Fixed:** Added these types to the editable file list

### Critical Issue #4: No Input Handler for Code/Text
**File:** `src/renderer/app.js` line 12360  
- `handleEditorInput()` didn't handle 'code' or 'text' type changes
- Early return meant changes weren't marked dirty
- **Fixed:** Added proper handler with dirty flag and save scheduling

## Files Modified

1. **src/main.js**
   - Implemented `workspace:saveExternalMarkdown` IPC handler
   - Added debug logging

2. **src/renderer/app.js**
   - Updated `persistNotes()` filter for all editable types
   - Updated `renderActiveNote()` to show code/text/html/notebook in editor
   - Updated `handleEditorInput()` to capture changes for all types
   - Added debug logging for autosave events

## How to Test

### Manual Test
1. Start the app: `npm start`
2. Open a folder with markdown files
3. Edit any markdown file
4. Watch the status bar - should show "Saving…" then "Saved."
5. Close the app without manually saving
6. Reopen the app and the same folder
7. Verify changes are still there

### Check Debug Logs

**Browser Console (Press Cmd+Option+I):**
```
[Save] Saving: /path/to/file.md Content length: 1234
[Save] Result: /path/to/file.md {success: true}
```

**Terminal Output:**
```
[IPC] saveExternalMarkdown called: /path/to/file.md content length: 1234
[IPC] File saved successfully: /path/to/file.md
```

### Test Files to Verify

The fix supports these file types:
- ✅ `*.md` - Markdown
- ✅ `*.tex` - LaTeX
- ✅ `*.html` - HTML
- ✅ `*.txt` - Text
- ✅ `*.js, *.py, *.java, etc` - Code files
- ✅ `*.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebooks

## Technical Details

### Save Flow
```
User edits file
    ↓
handleEditorInput() fires
    ↓
Sets note.dirty = true
    ↓
Calls scheduleSave()
    ↓
400ms debounce timeout
    ↓
persistNotes() executes
    ↓
Filters dirty notes with absolutePath
    ↓
Calls window.api.saveExternalMarkdown() for each
    ↓
IPC to main process
    ↓
folderManager.saveMarkdownFile() writes to disk
    ↓
Returns success result
    ↓
Sets note.dirty = false
    ↓
Shows "Saved." status
```

### Autosave Behavior
- Saves trigger after 400ms of inactivity (debounce)
- Or manually with "Save Now" button
- Or when autosave is enabled (default)
- Autosave interval configurable in settings (default 30s)

## Verification Checklist

- [x] folderManager.saveMarkdownFile() works (tested)
- [x] IPC handler properly calls folderManager
- [x] persistNotes() includes all editable types
- [x] renderActiveNote() shows all types in editor
- [x] handleEditorInput() captures changes for all types
- [x] Debug logging added for troubleshooting
- [x] No syntax errors in modified files
