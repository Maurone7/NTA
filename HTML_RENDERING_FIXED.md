# HTML File Rendering Fix - Summary

## Issues Found

### Issue #1: HTML Viewer CSS Fragmentation
**File:** `src/renderer/styles.css`
- There were TWO conflicting `.html-viewer` CSS definitions
- Line 2722: Base definition with `display: none`
- Line 2797: Duplicate definition missing proper flex properties
- This caused CSS cascade conflicts and prevented proper layout

**Fix:** Consolidated into a single definition with all necessary properties:
```css
.html-viewer {
  display: none;                    /* Hidden by default */
  flex: 1;                          /* Takes remaining space */
  flex-direction: column;           /* Stack children vertically */
  width: 100%;
  min-height: 0;
  margin: 0;
  background: var(--bg-elevated);
  color: var(--fg);
  position: relative;
}
```

### Issue #2: How HTML-Mode Shows the Viewer
When an HTML file is active:
- CSS class `html-mode` is added to `.workspace__content`
- Rule at line 2908 shows the viewer: `.workspace__content.html-mode .html-viewer { display: flex; }`
- The markdown preview is hidden: `.workspace__content.html-mode #markdown-preview { display: none; }`

## How HTML Rendering Works

### Single HTML File (Active)
1. User opens/clicks an HTML file
2. `renderActiveNote()` is called with HTML file
3. Class `html-mode` added to workspace content
4. CSS shows the `.html-viewer` container (previously hidden)
5. `renderHtmlPreview()` loads the HTML file
6. File content set to iframe via `srcdoc` or `src`
7. Iframe renders the HTML

### Embedded HTML in Markdown
When markdown contains `![[file.html]]`:
1. Markdown parser creates an `<iframe class="html-embed-iframe">` with `data-raw-src`
2. `processPreviewHtmlIframes()` runs after markdown rendering
3. For each iframe:
   - Resolves the file path using `window.api.resolveResource()`
   - Loads HTML content via `fetch()`
   - Sets iframe `srcdoc` with the HTML content
   - Registers `onload` callback to auto-resize iframe
4. HTML renders inside the embedded iframe within the markdown preview

## Files Modified

**src/renderer/styles.css:**
- Consolidated `.html-viewer` CSS definitions
- Removed duplicate/conflicting rules
- Ensured proper flex layout with `display: flex`

## What Should Now Work

✅ **Opening HTML files as main document:**
- Open any `.html` file from the file tree
- Should display in the right preview pane
- Fully rendered HTML with scripts/forms working

✅ **Embedded HTML in markdown:**
- Write `![[path/to/file.html]]` in markdown
- Should show as an interactive iframe
- Not as plain text

✅ **HTML viewer styling:**
- Proper flex layout for responsive sizing
- Iframe takes full available space
- Proper background colors and positioning

## Testing

### Test 1: View HTML File
1. Create a test HTML file in the workspace
2. Click on it in the file tree
3. Should show rendered HTML in the preview pane (not plain text or in editor)

### Test 2: Embed HTML in Markdown
1. Create a markdown file
2. Add line: `![[test.html]]` (where test.html exists)
3. Preview should show the HTML rendered in an iframe
4. Should NOT show as plain HTML source code

### Test 3: HTML with Scripts
1. Create HTML with JavaScript:
   ```html
   <button onclick="alert('clicked!')">Click Me</button>
   ```
2. Open it or embed it
3. Click button - alert should work
4. Confirms scripts are executed (not just displayed as text)
