## 📞 FAQ

### Q: Where do I start?
A: Start with IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md (10 min), then QUICK_ACTION_ITEMS.md (30 min)

### Q: What if I only have 6 hours?
A: Do Week 1 quick wins from QUICK_ACTION_ITEMS.md - get 30-40% performance gain

### Q: How do I know if changes work?
A: Run `npm test` after each change. Check performance metrics in CODE_IMPROVEMENTS_ANALYSIS.md

### Q: Should I do all improvements?
A: Start with Phase 1 (Week 1). That gives best ROI. Consider Phase 2-3 later.

### Q: What if something breaks?
A: Each change is independent. Roll back with `git revert`. Tests catch most issues.
