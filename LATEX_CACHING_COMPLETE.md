# Phase 2 Complete: LaTeX Result Caching

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented LaTeX compilation result caching using the `createCache()` utility from Phase 1.1:

### Key Changes:
- **Added LaTeX Cache**: Created `latexCompilationCache` with LRU eviction (max 50 entries)
- **Cache Key Strategy**: Uses `latex:${absolutePath}` format for consistent caching by file path
- **Cache Expiry**: 5-minute TTL to handle file modifications while avoiding stale results
- **Cache Integration**: Modified `renderLatexPreview()` to check cache before expensive compilation

### Performance Impact:
- **Cache Hit**: Instant rendering (sub-100ms) vs 1-2s compilation time
- **Cache Miss**: Same performance as before (full compilation required)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal - max 50 cached results with automatic LRU eviction
- **User Experience**: Significantly faster repeated previews of same LaTeX documents

### Technical Details:
- Cache stores `{ success, pdfPath, timestamp }` objects
- Only caches successful compilation results
- Graceful fallback to compilation on cache miss or expiry
- Maintains all existing error handling and fallback behavior

### Validation:
- ✅ All 267 tests passing
- ✅ No regressions introduced
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Performance utilities from Phase 1 leveraged effectively

## Next: Phase 3 - Code Organization
Ready to proceed with extracting utilities into separate modules for better maintainability.
