## 💡 How to Use

### For Each Utility

**Event Manager:**
```javascript
const id = eventManager.on(element, 'click', handler);
eventManager.off(id);
```

**Regex Cache:**
```javascript
const regex = regexCache.get(pattern, flags);
// Pre-compiled patterns available immediately
```

**Tab Indexing:**
```javascript
const paneTabs = tabIndexes.getTabsByPane('left');
const noteTabs = tabIndexes.getTabsByNote(noteId);
```

**Batch DOM Updates:**
```javascript
batchDOMUpdater.add(() => element.classList.add('active'));
```

**DOM Helpers:**
```javascript
const editors = getActiveEditorElements();
const keys = getValidPaneKeys();
```
