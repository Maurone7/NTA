## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

**src/latex-installer.js** - Added `showDistributionPicker()` function
```javascript
async function showDistributionPicker(mainWindow) {
  // Shows comparison dialog
  // User selects distribution
  // Returns selected distribution object
  // Returns: { name, size, description, installTime, command, recommended }
}
```

**src/renderer/app.js** - Uses updated installer
```javascript
// When user clicks "Install" button in toast:
const result = await window.api.installLatex();
// Shows distribution picker
// User selects option
// Installation runs in background
```

### Dialog Structure

The distribution picker shows:
- Icon + Distribution name
- Size (disk space)
- Installation time estimate
- Key features (bullet points)
- Recommended flag for BasicTeX

### Data Structure

Each distribution object contains:
```javascript
{
  name: 'BasicTeX',                    // Display name
  size: '400 MB',                      // Disk space
  description: '...',                  // One-line description
  installTime: '2-5 min',              // Time estimate
  command: 'brew install basictex',    // Installation command
  recommended: true                    // Show "Recommended" label
}
```

---

## Behavior & Edge Cases

### macOS Only
The distribution picker currently shows for macOS only (where `brew` is available).

For Linux/Windows, users see platform-specific instructions in a separate dialog.

### User Selection
- **BasicTeX selected**: 
  - Fast download (~2-5 min)
  - Packages auto-install as needed
  - Total size grows to ~1-1.5 GB

- **MacTeX-No-GUI selected**:
  - Longer download (~15-30 min)
  - Everything pre-installed
  - Fixed size of 2.0 GB

- **TinyTeX selected**:
  - Very fast (~1-2 min)
  - Minimal but complete
  - Grows to ~500 MB - 1 GB with use

### Cancellation
If user cancels at any point, the app continues to work normally and falls back to HTML export.

### Multiple Installations
If user clicks "Install" again, the flow repeats. The system detects if LaTeX is already installed and skips installation.
