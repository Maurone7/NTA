# Rename Feature: Complete Implementation Summary

## Final Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The rename feature has been successfully implemented with the file rename input appearing **inline in the tree** where the file is located, not in the title bar.

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Core Rename Feature (Previous Work)
- ✅ Fixed CSS: `.workspace__filename-wrapper` changed from `display: none` to `display: flex`
- ✅ Added Enter key handling for form submission
- ✅ Implemented IPC handler for `workspace:renameMarkdownFile`

### Phase 2: Move Rename to Inline Tree (Current Work)
- ✅ Created `startInlineRename()` in tree.js to show editable input in tree node
- ✅ Created `completeInlineRename()` to handle form submission
- ✅ Created `cancelInlineRename()` to cancel edit mode
- ✅ Added `performRename()` function in app.js
- ✅ Added CSS styling for `.tree-node__rename-input`
- ✅ Integrated with tree module initialization

## Technical Architecture

### Tree Module Functions (tree.js)

```javascript
startInlineRename(noteId)
  ├─ Finds tree node
  ├─ Creates editable input
  ├─ Replaces name span with input
  ├─ Focuses and selects text
  └─ Attaches key handlers (Enter, Escape, Blur)

completeInlineRename(noteId, newName)
  ├─ Validates new name
  ├─ Replaces input with name span
  ├─ Calls actions.performRename()
  └─ Restores original on failure

cancelInlineRename(noteId, originalName)
  └─ Replaces input with original name span
```

### App Module Function (app.js)

```javascript
performRename(noteId, newFilename)
  ├─ Gets note by ID
  ├─ Sets as active note
  ├─ Calls renameActiveNote()
  ├─ Calls IPC to main process
  ├─ Updates workspace tree
  └─ Returns success boolean
```

### Rename Flow Diagram

```
User right-clicks file
        ↓
Context menu opens
        ↓
User clicks "Rename"
        ↓
handleContextMenuAction('rename')
        ↓
startInlineRename(noteId)
        ↓
Input field appears in tree
(file name is now editable)
        ↓
User types new name + presses Enter
        ↓
completeInlineRename(noteId, newName)
        ↓
performRename(noteId, newName)
        ↓
renameActiveNote(newName)
        ↓
window.api.renameMarkdownFile() [IPC]
        ↓
Main process renames file
        ↓
adoptWorkspace() updates state
        ↓
Tree renders with new filename
```

## User Experience

### Before (Title Bar)
- Rename input appeared in the top title bar area
- Had to look away from tree to see/edit the name
- Disconnect between where file is and where you edit name

### After (Inline in Tree)
- Rename input appears directly on the file name in tree
- User can see the file context while editing
- Matches modern UX patterns (VS Code, Finder, etc.)
- More intuitive and discoverable

### Keyboard Interaction
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Enter | Submit rename |
| Escape | Cancel rename |
| Tab/Click Away | Submit rename |

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/renderer/tree.js` | Added inline rename functions |
| `src/renderer/app.js` | Added performRename function |
| `src/renderer/styles.css` | Added rename input styling |

## Testing

Created diagnostic tests:
- `tests/e2e/rename-file-diagnostic.spec.js` - Tests full rename flow
- `tests/e2e/inline-tree-rename.spec.js` - Tests inline tree rename

## Known Limitations
None identified - feature is complete and functional.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Inline rename on double-click or F2
- Confirmation dialog for overwriting existing files
- Undo functionality
- Drag-to-rename support
