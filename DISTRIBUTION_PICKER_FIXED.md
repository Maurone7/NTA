# ✅ Distribution Picker Dialog - Fixed

## What Changed

**Issue:** When user clicked "Install", they only saw generic MacTeX installation instructions instead of the distribution picker dialog.

**Root Cause:** `main.js` was calling the old `showInstallationDialog()` function instead of the new `attemptAutoInstall()` function that shows the distribution picker.

**Fix:** Updated `main.js` to call `attemptAutoInstall()` which displays the beautiful comparison table.

## Technical Changes

ipcMain.handle('app:installLatex', async (_event) => {
  const result = await showInstallationDialog(win);
  return result;
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
const { attemptAutoInstall } = require('./latex-installer');

ipcMain.handle('app:installLatex', async (_event) => {
