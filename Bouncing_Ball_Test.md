# Bouncing Ball Demo Test

This note tests the HTML script execution functionality!

## Embedded HTML Demo

![Bouncing Ball Demo](./bouncing-ball-demo.html)

The demo above should show:
- âœ… Interactive bouncing balls with physics
- âœ… Clickable controls (Start, Pause, Reset, Add Ball)  
- âœ… Canvas interaction (click to add balls)
- âœ… Real-time ball count updates
- âœ… Smooth animations and gradients

## Features Being Tested

1. **HTML File Embedding**: The demo is loaded from `bouncing-ball-demo.html`
2. **JavaScript Execution**: Full interactive script support
3. **Canvas API**: HTML5 canvas with animations
4. **Event Handling**: Mouse clicks and button interactions
5. **Sandboxed Security**: Running safely in iframe

## Expected Behavior

- The demo should auto-start when loaded
- Balls should bounce around with realistic physics
- All buttons should be functional
- Clicking on the canvas should add new balls
- No console errors or security warnings

If everything works, the HTML script support is successfully implemented! ðŸŽ‰
