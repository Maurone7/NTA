# TinyTeX Lightest LaTeX Option - Implementation Complete ✅

## What Was Done

Successfully added **TinyTeX** as the lightest LaTeX compiler option for users who want minimal installation size and fastest setup time.

## Changes Summary

### File Modified: `src/latex-installer.js`

#### Added TinyTeX Distribution Option
```javascript
{
  name: 'TinyTeX',
  size: '150 MB',
  description: 'Ultra-lightweight LaTeX with auto-install packages',
  installTime: '1-2 min',
  command: `${brewPath} install tinytex`,
  recommended: true
}
```

#### Updated Distribution Picker Dialog
Now shows **3 options** instead of 2:
1. ⚡ TinyTeX (Lightest) - 150 MB [NEW, RECOMMENDED]
2. 📦 BasicTeX - 400 MB
3. 📚 MacTeX-No-GUI (Full) - 2 GB

#### Updated Progress Monitoring
Installation progress now accounts for TinyTeX's faster installation:
```javascript
const estimatedTotal = distribution === 'TinyTeX' ? 60 : 
                       distribution === 'BasicTeX' ? 180 : 1320; // seconds
```

## Size Comparison

| Distribution | Size | Installation Time | Reduction |
|------------|------|------------------|-----------|
| **TinyTeX** ⚡ | **150 MB** | **1-2 min** | — |
| BasicTeX | 400 MB | 2-5 min | 62.5% smaller than BasicTeX |
| MacTeX-No-GUI | 2.0 GB | 15-30 min | 92.5% smaller than MacTeX |

## User Interface
