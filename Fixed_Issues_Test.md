# Fixed Issues Test

This note tests the fixes for file suggestions and HTML iframe sizing.

## Test 1: File Suggestion Positioning

Try typing `![` followed by `demo` or `bouncing` - the file suggestions should now appear:
- âœ… **Near your cursor** (not at the bottom of the screen)
- âœ… **Positioned correctly** below the text you're typing
- âœ… **Stay visible** long enough to click them
- âœ… **Don't go off-screen** (automatically repositioned if needed)

## Test 2: HTML Iframe Sizing

![Bouncing Ball Demo](./bouncing-ball-demo.html)

The bouncing ball demo above should now:
- âœ… **Show the complete interface** (no horizontal cutoff)
- âœ… **Be responsive** to iframe width
- âœ… **Have proper height** (600px with resize handle)
- âœ… **Scale the canvas** appropriately
- âœ… **Allow vertical resizing** by dragging the bottom-right corner

## Test 3: Simple Demo

![Simple Demo](./demo.html)

This should also display properly without cutoff.

## Expected Improvements

1. **File Suggestions**: Now use accurate cursor positioning with temporary DOM measurement
2. **HTML Content**: Canvas and containers are now responsive and won't be cut off
3. **Iframe Sizing**: Increased height to 600px with resize capability
4. **Screen Boundaries**: Suggestions automatically avoid going off-screen

Both issues should now be resolved! ðŸŽ‰
