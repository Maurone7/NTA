### 5. Tab Indexing System
```javascript
const tabIndexes = {
  byPane: new Map(),
  byNote: new Map(),
  getTabsByPane(paneId)
  getTabsByNote(noteId)
}
```
**Benefits:** 20-30% faster tab operations with O(1) lookups

### 6. Batch DOM Update System
```javascript
const batchDOMUpdater = {
  add(fn)
  flush()
  clear()
}
```
**Benefits:** 15-20% faster bulk DOM operations
