# LaTeX PDF Display Fix

## Problem
When opening `.tex` files that compile to PDF successfully, the rendered PDF was only showing in the bottom half of the preview panel instead of filling the entire panel.

## Root Cause
When `renderLatexPreview` successfully compiled a LaTeX file to PDF and called `renderPdfPreview()`, the workspace mode class was not being switched from `latex-mode` to `pdf-mode`. This meant the CSS styling for PDF mode was not applied, resulting in the markdown preview container not being hidden, and the PDF viewer not filling the full height of the preview pane.

## Solution
Added mode class switching in `renderLatexPreview` when a PDF is successfully compiled:

```javascript
// Before calling renderPdfPreview, switch the workspace mode
elements.workspaceContent?.classList.remove('latex-mode');
elements.workspaceContent?.classList.add('pdf-mode');
```

This ensures:
1. The `pdf-mode` CSS rules are applied
2. The markdown preview is hidden (`#markdown-preview { display: none; }`)
3. The PDF viewer fills the entire preview pane with `flex: 1` and `height: 100%`

## Files Changed
- `/Users/mauro/Desktop/NoteTakingApp/src/renderer/app.js` - Added mode class switching in `renderLatexPreview` function (lines 8529-8530)

## Testing
- All LaTeX behavior tests pass (23 tests)
- PDF viewer now displays full-size when LaTeX compiles to PDF
- Fallback to HTML rendering with math expressions still works when PDF compilation fails
- Mode is properly restored when switching between files

## CSS Rules Applied
- `.workspace__content.pdf-mode #markdown-preview { display: none; }`
- `.pdf-viewer { flex: 1; width: 100%; min-height: 0; }`
- `.pdf-viewer.visible { display: block; height: 100%; }`
