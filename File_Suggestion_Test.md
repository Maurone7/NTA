# File Suggestion Test

Let's test if file suggestions work properly now without being interrupted by workspace updates.

## Try typing these:

1. Type `![` and then type `demo` - you should see suggestions for demo.html
2. Type `![` and then type `bouncing` - you should see bouncing-ball-demo.html
3. The suggestions should stay open long enough for you to click them

## Expected Files to Suggest:
- demo.html 🌐
- bouncing-ball-demo.html 🌐
- Any .mp4, .webm video files if you have them 🎬
- Any .jpg, .png image files if you have them 🖼️

The file suggestions should now:
✅ Stay open for at least 2 seconds
✅ Not be closed by workspace file watcher updates
✅ Only update workspace when you're not actively typing
✅ Show proper icons for different file types

Test it out!
