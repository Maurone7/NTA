# How to Verify if Your PDF Was Compiled with LaTeX

## Quick Answer

To check if your exported PDF was compiled with LaTeX instead of exported from HTML:

### Option 1: Use the provided verification tool (Easiest)
```bash
node scripts/verify-latex-pdf.js your-file.pdf
```

This will show you:
- ✅ Compilation method (LaTeX vs HTML)
- Producer information
- PDF structure validation
- File size metrics

### Option 2: Check PDF metadata (macOS/Linux)
```bash
strings your-file.pdf | grep Producer
```

**LaTeX PDFs show:** `pdfTeX`, `xetex`, or `LuaTeX`  
**HTML PDFs show:** `Chromium` or `HeadlessChrome`

## Why Does This Matter?

The Note Taking App supports two different ways to export LaTeX files to PDF:

| Feature | LaTeX Compilation | HTML Export |
|---------|---|---|
| **Math Quality** | Perfect (native TeX rendering) | Good (MathML-based) |
| **Typography** | Optimized (Knuth's algorithm) | Standard (CSS-based) |
| **File Size** | Smaller (20-50 KB typical) | Larger (rasterization) |
| **Quality** | Publication-ready | Web-friendly |

## What the Tests Verify

The app includes comprehensive tests to ensure proper PDF compilation:

### 1. **Compilation Verification Test**
```bash
npm test -- --grep "should verify exported PDF was compiled with LaTeX"
```
✓ Verifies PDF has correct signatures  
✓ Checks for TeX engine markers  
✓ Validates PDF structure  
✓ Confirms file is properly compiled  

### 2. **Distinction Test**
```bash
npm test -- --grep "should distinguish between LaTeX-compiled"
```
✓ Verifies app routes LaTeX files correctly  
✓ Confirms fallback to HTML when LaTeX unavailable  
✓ Checks export path detection  

### 3. **Producer Detection Test**
```bash
npm test -- --grep "should validate PDF producer"
```
✓ Tests producer field parsing  
✓ Distinguishes LaTeX from HTML PDFs  
✓ Validates mock PDF detection  

## How the Export Flow Works

```
User exports LaTeX file to PDF
            ↓
   Is LaTeX installed?
      /            \
    YES            NO
     ↓              ↓
Compile with    Fallback to
 pdflatex       HTML export
     ↓              ↓
PDF created    PDF created
(LaTeX)        (Chromium)
     ↓              ↓
 Show status message (success or fallback notice)
```

## Checking Your System

### Is LaTeX installed?
```bash
pdflatex --version
# or
xelatex --version
```

### Install LaTeX

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install mactex
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt install texlive-latex-base
```

**Windows:**
Download from https://miktex.org/

### Verify Installation in App
1. Open Developer Tools (Cmd+Shift+I)
2. Look for console messages about LaTeX status
3. First PDF export will show installation status

## Understanding the Test Results

### ✓ All Tests Passing = LaTeX Export Working
When you see in the test output:
- "should verify exported PDF was compiled with LaTeX"
- "should distinguish between LaTeX-compiled PDF"
- "should validate PDF producer"

This means LaTeX PDF export is fully functional.

### ⊘ Skipped Test = LaTeX Not Installed
If you see:
- "should verify exported PDF was compiled with LaTeX (pending)"

This means LaTeX is not installed on your system, but the app will still export to PDF using HTML fallback.

## Integration Testing

Run the integration test to verify PDF detection works:
```bash
node scripts/test-pdf-verification.js
```

This creates mock PDFs and verifies the detection works correctly.

## PDF Metadata Details

### LaTeX PDF (pdfTeX example)
```
%PDF-1.4
...
/Creator (TeX)
/Producer (pdfTeX-1.40.21)
...
```

### HTML PDF (Chromium example)
```
%PDF-1.4
...
/Creator (HeadlessChrome)
/Producer (Chromium)
...
```

## Troubleshooting

### "PDF was exported from HTML" but LaTeX is installed
1. Check LaTeX version: `pdflatex --version`
2. Restart the app
3. Try exporting again
4. Check console for compilation errors (Dev Tools)

### Test fails: "should verify exported PDF was compiled with LaTeX"
1. This test requires LaTeX installed
2. Install LaTeX per instructions above
3. Restart the app
4. Run tests again: `npm test`

### Manual verification isn't working
1. Ensure PDF file exists and is readable
2. Try the tool: `node scripts/verify-latex-pdf.js <file>`
3. Check file size is reasonable (> 1KB)
4. Verify PDF is valid: `file <filename>.pdf`
