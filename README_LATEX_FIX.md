# 🎉 LaTeX Installation - COMPLETE FIX

## What Was Wrong

The app couldn't install LaTeX because brew needed a `sudo` password, but the installation was running in a **detached background process** with **no terminal**, so it couldn't prompt you.

Error message:
```
sudo: a terminal is required to read the password
```

## What's Fixed

Changed the installation to run **interactively** so:
1. ✅ Terminal window appears during installation
2. ✅ You can see what's happening
3. ✅ You can enter your password when prompted
4. ✅ Installation completes successfully
5. ✅ PDF export with LaTeX works!

## Key Change

```javascript
// BEFORE (Silent background process - FAILED)
spawn('bash', ['-c', command], {
  stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe'],
  detached: true
});

// AFTER (Interactive process - WORKS)
spawn('bash', ['-c', command], {
  stdio: 'inherit',    // Show output, accept input
  detached: false      // Monitor the process
});
```

## How to Test

### 1. Start the app:
```bash
npm start
```

### 2. Try to export to PDF:
- Open a note
- Export → PDF (LaTeX)

### 3. Select BasicTeX:
- You'll see a picker dialog
- Select "BasicTeX (Recommended)"

### 4. Confirm installation:
- Click "Install in Background"

### 5. Enter your password:
- A **terminal window will appear** ← This is new and correct!
- You'll see: `Password: █`
- Type your Mac password
- Press Enter

### 6. Watch the installation:
- Terminal shows progress
- Status bar updates: "Installing BasicTeX... 25%"
- Takes 2-5 minutes for BasicTeX

### 7. Restart the app:
- Installation completes
- Terminal closes
- Restart the app

### 8. Test it works:
- Export to PDF again
- Should work! ✓
