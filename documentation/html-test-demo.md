# HTML Code Block Test

This markdown file contains an HTML code block that should render as an interactive application, not raw text.

!![[trial.html]]

## How to Test

1. Open this markdown file in your note-taking app
2. The HTML code block above should render as an interactive counter application
3. You should see buttons that actually work when clicked
4. If you only see raw HTML text instead of the interactive app, the fix didn't work

## Expected Behavior

- **Working**: Beautiful gradient background, clickable + and - buttons, reset button, counter that changes color based on value
- **Broken**: Raw HTML code displayed as plain text

This test will clearly show whether HTML code blocks are rendering as interactive applications or just displaying raw text.
