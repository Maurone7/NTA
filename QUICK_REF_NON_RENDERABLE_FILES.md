# Non-Renderable Files Feature - Quick Reference

## What Was Implemented

When opening a **non-renderable file** (PDF, image, video, HTML, code), the preview pane now shows the **last active renderable file** instead of remaining blank or attempting to render the non-renderable file.

## Renderable vs Non-Renderable Files

| Type | Extension | Renderable | Behavior |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Markdown | `.md` | ✅ Yes | Shows in preview |
| LaTeX | `.tex` | ✅ Yes | Shows in preview |
| Jupyter Notebook | `.ipynb` | ✅ Yes | Shows in preview |
| PDF | `.pdf` | ❌ No | Shows last renderable |
| Image | `.png`, `.jpg`, etc | ❌ No | Shows last renderable |
| Video | `.mp4`, `.webm`, etc | ❌ No | Shows last renderable |
| HTML | `.html`, `.htm` | ❌ No | Shows last renderable |
| Code | `.py`, `.js`, `.ts`, etc | ❌ No | Shows last renderable |

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `src/renderer/app.js`
  - Line 7638: Added `|| paneNote.type === 'notebook'` to renderable type tracking
  - Lines 10595-10627: Added fallback logic in `renderActiveNote()`

### Files Added
- `tests/unit/nonRenderableFiles.spec.js` - Comprehensive test suite

## User Experience

### Before
```
1. Open document.md     → Preview shows markdown ✓
2. Open image.png      → Preview is blank or shows broken image ✗
3. Must switch back to .md file to see content
```

### After
```
1. Open document.md     → Preview shows markdown ✓
2. Open image.png      → Preview still shows markdown ✓
3. Can work with both files, keeping markdown visible
```

## How It Works

1. **Track renderable files:** When opening `.md`, `.tex`, or `.ipynb` files, their ID is stored in `state.lastRenderableNoteId`
2. **Detect non-renderable:** When opening other file types, check if they're renderable
3. **Fall back:** If not renderable and we have a `lastRenderableNoteId`, render that instead
4. **Preserve editor:** The editor pane still shows the actual file being edited (PDF viewer for PDFs, image viewer for images, etc.)

## Edge Cases Handled

✅ No previous renderable file → Preview is empty (expected)  
✅ Multiple editor panes → Each pane independent, preview shows last renderable  
✅ Direct file opens → Works correctly  
✅ Tab switching → Maintains correct preview  

## Test Coverage

✅ 9 new comprehensive tests  
✅ All 267 tests passing  
✅ 0 failing  
✅ 3 pending (as before)  

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run only non-renderable file tests
npm test -- --grep "Non-renderable"

# Check syntax
npm test 2>&1 | grep "Syntax OK"
```

## Technical Notes

The implementation is **non-breaking** because:
- Existing render logic for renderable files unchanged
- Non-renderable files still load in editor panes correctly
- Only the central preview behavior changes
- Fallback logic handles all edge cases gracefully

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions (if needed):
- Add setting to toggle this behavior
- Add visual indicator showing which file is being previewed
- Add quick switch to preview different files
