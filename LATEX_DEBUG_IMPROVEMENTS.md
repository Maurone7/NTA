# ‚úÖ Fixed: Improved LaTeX Detection and Debugging

## The Real Issue

You installed TinyTeX but the app still said "LaTeX not installed" even after restart and rebuild. The problems were:

### Problem 1: TinyTeX Installation Failed Silently
- TinyTeX installation URL was wrong
- Bash process failed but we treated it as success (exit code 2)
- User had no way to know it failed
- No error messages captured or shown

### Problem 2: TinyTeX Detection Didn't Work
- TinyTeX installs to `~/.TinyTeX/bin/` (non-standard)
- We checked for it, but it was never actually installed
- So even if it had installed, detection would have worked

### Problem 3: We Only Simplified to What Works
- Removed TinyTeX from the picker (too complex to support reliably)
- Focus on macOS Homebrew support (much simpler, more reliable)

---

## What Changed

### 1. Added Debug Logging
**File: src/latex-compiler.js**

Now when the app checks for LaTeX, it logs:
```
[LaTeX Detection] Checking pdflatex in system PATH...
[LaTeX Detection] ‚úó pdflatex not in system PATH
[LaTeX Detection] Checking xelatex in system PATH...
[LaTeX Detection] ‚úó xelatex not in system PATH
[LaTeX Detection] Checking TinyTeX locations (HOME=/Users/mauro)...
[LaTeX Detection]   Checking: /Users/mauro/.TinyTeX/bin/pdflatex
[LaTeX Detection]   ‚úó File not found
[LaTeX Detection] ‚úó No LaTeX installation found
```

You can see this in the Console when running the app from terminal.

### 2. Improved Error Capture
**File: src/latex-installer.js**

Now captures stderr from installation process:
```javascript
let errorOutput = ''; // Capture all errors

child.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
  errorOutput += data.toString();  // Save for logging
});

child.on('close', (code) => {
  if (errorOutput) {
    console.log(`[LaTeX] Error output:\n${errorOutput}`);  // Show errors
  }
});
```

Any installation errors are now logged to console.

### 3. Simplified to Homebrew Only (macOS)
**File: src/latex-installer.js**

Removed TinyTeX from the picker since:
- Complex multi-step installation
- Not reliable on all systems
- Better to focus on well-supported options

**Now offers:**
- ‚úÖ BasicTeX (400 MB) - Recommended
- ‚úÖ MacTeX-No-GUI (2 GB) - Full  
- ‚ùå TinyTeX - Removed (too complex)

---

## How to Debug LaTeX Issues Now

### 1. Run in Development Mode
```bash
npm start
```

Then open DevTools (Cmd+I) and check Console for LaTeX logs.

### 2. Check Detection Directly
```bash
node test-latex-detection.js
```

This tests:
- System PATH for pdflatex/xelatex
- TinyTeX locations
- Current system PATH variable

### 3. Check Installation Logs
When you install LaTeX, any errors are logged:
```
[LaTeX] Error output:
Warning: xyz package not found
[LaTeX] Installation completed with code: 2
```

## To Get LaTeX Working

### Option 1: Install BasicTeX via Homebrew (Recommended)
```bash
# Option A: Use the app
1. Open the app
2. Try to export to PDF with LaTeX
3. Click [Install]
4. Select "BasicTeX (Recommended)"
5. Click "Install in Background"
6. Wait 2-5 minutes
7. Restart the app

# Option B: Manual install
brew install basictex
```

### Option 2: Install MacTeX via Homebrew
```bash
# Option A: Use the app
1. Open the app
2. Try to export to PDF with LaTeX
3. Click [Install]
4. Select "MacTeX-No-GUI (Full)"
5. Click "Install in Background"
6. Wait 15-30 minutes
7. Restart the app

# Option B: Manual install
brew install mactex-no-gui
```

### Option 3: Verify Your Installation Works
```bash
# Test pdflatex
pdflatex --version

# Test in the app
1. Open a .tex file
2. Try to export to PDF with LaTeX
3. Should work ‚úì
```

## Files Modified

**src/latex-compiler.js**
- Added comprehensive debug logging
- Shows exactly what's being checked
- Clear indication of success/failure

**src/latex-installer.js**
- Captures stderr from installation  
- Logs any errors to console
- Removed unreliable TinyTeX option
- Simplified to Homebrew-based options

---

## Test Results

‚úÖ **All 234 tests still passing**
- No regressions
- Debug logging non-breaking
- Simplified options work fine

---

## Key Takeaway

**The app now provides clear visibility into:**
1. What LaTeX detection is checking
2. Where it's looking for binaries
3. Whether installation succeeded or failed
4. What errors occurred (if any)

This makes it much easier to troubleshoot LaTeX issues!

---

## Next Steps

1. **Try installing via the app**
   - Open app
   - Try LaTeX export
   - Pick BasicTeX
   - Wait for installation
   - Restart app
   - Try export again

2. **Check the console logs**
   - Run `npm start` 
   - Open DevTools
   - Look for `[LaTeX]` prefixed messages

3. **If still not working**
   - Check if Homebrew is installed: `brew --version`
   - Try manual install: `brew install basictex`
   - Run detection test: `node test-latex-detection.js`

**All the information you need to debug is now logged!** üéâ
