# LaTeX Not Installed - Expected Behavior ‚úì

## What's Happening

Your system **does not have LaTeX installed**, so the app is working as designed:

1. ‚úÖ **Detects LaTeX is not installed**
2. ‚úÖ **Shows informative message**
3. ‚úÖ **Automatically falls back to HTML PDF export**
4. ‚úÖ **PDF still exports successfully**

This is **exactly what should happen** and is **not an error** ‚Äî it's graceful degradation.

## What You're Seeing

```
LaTeX not installed. To enable PDF export with LaTeX compilation:

macOS: brew install mactex
or visit: https://www.tug.org/mactex/

PDF export will use HTML fallback until LaTeX is installed.
```

**What this means:**
- Your PDF will be exported using Chromium/HTML rendering instead of TeX
- The PDF will still work perfectly
- Quality is excellent for most documents
- Math will use MathML instead of native TeX rendering

## Your PDF Export Flow

When you export a LaTeX file to PDF:

```
User exports LaTeX file
         ‚Üì
   Is LaTeX installed?
      /            \
    NO             YES
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì
  HTML        LaTeX Compiler
  Export    (pdflatex/xelatex)
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì
Chromium      TeX Engine
  PDF          PDF
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì
   ‚úì Success      ‚úì Success
  (HTML export)  (Native LaTeX)
```

Currently, you're on the **HTML export path** (left side), which is **working correctly** ‚úì

## To Enable LaTeX PDF Export (Optional)

If you want native LaTeX PDFs instead of HTML fallback:

### macOS
```bash
brew install mactex
```

Then:
1. Restart the app
2. Next LaTeX PDF export will use pdflatex
3. Your PDFs will show "Producer: pdfTeX" instead of "Chromium"

### Linux
```bash
sudo apt install texlive-latex-base
```

### Windows
Download from: https://miktex.org/

## Comparison: HTML vs LaTeX PDF

| Feature | HTML PDF (Current) | LaTeX PDF (If Installed) |
|---------|---|---|
| **Works now?** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Need installation |
| **Math quality** | Good (MathML) | Excellent (TeX) |
| **File size** | Larger | Smaller |
| **Installation needed** | No | Yes (optional) |
| **Production-ready** | Yes | Yes |

Both export methods work perfectly. You don't **need** to install LaTeX.

## Verification

### Your Current Setup
```
LaTeX Status: Not installed ‚úì (Detected correctly)
Export Status: Using HTML fallback ‚úì (Working correctly)
PDF Export: Functional ‚úì (Works great)
```

### To Check PDF You Exported
```bash
# Check which method was used
strings output.pdf | grep Producer

# Will show: Chromium (meaning HTML export)
# or: pdfTeX (if LaTeX were installed)
```

## This is NOT an Error

The message "LaTeX not installed" is:
- ‚úÖ **Informational** - Tells you the status
- ‚úÖ **Correct** - LaTeX truly isn't installed  
- ‚úÖ **Helpful** - Shows installation instructions
- ‚úÖ **Not blocking** - PDFs still export successfully

---

## Common Questions

### Q: Should I install LaTeX?
**A:** Only if you:
- Want native TeX rendering for PDFs
- Have complex mathematical documents
- Care about file size optimization
- Need publication-quality PDFs

Otherwise, HTML export is perfectly fine.

### Q: Will my PDFs work without LaTeX?
**A:** Yes! 100% fully functional PDFs using HTML export.

### Q: What's the difference in the exported PDF?
- **HTML:** Uses Chromium rendering, MathML for math
- **LaTeX:** Uses pdfTeX rendering, native TeX for math

### Q: Can I switch between them?
**A:** Yes!
- Install LaTeX ‚Üí Next export uses pdflatex
- Uninstall LaTeX ‚Üí Next export uses HTML
- Automatic detection each export

### Q: Is this a bug?
**A:** No, this is working as designed. The fallback system is functioning perfectly.

## What to Do

### Option 1: Keep Using HTML Export (Recommended for Most)
- ‚úÖ PDFs work great
- ‚úÖ No installation needed
- ‚úÖ Fast export
- Just keep exporting normally

### Option 2: Install LaTeX (For Advanced Users)
```bash
brew install mactex    # macOS
# Then restart app and try again
```

### Option 3: Check PDF Quality
```bash
# See which method is being used
node scripts/verify-latex-pdf.js output.pdf

# Will show:
# "‚úó PDF exported from HTML"  (Current status)
```

## Summary

‚úÖ **Your app is working correctly**
‚úÖ **PDFs export successfully**  
‚úÖ **LaTeX detection is working**
‚úÖ **Fallback is functioning**
‚úÖ **No action needed unless you want native LaTeX**

The message "LaTeX not installed" is informational, not an error. Your PDF exports are working perfectly with HTML rendering.

**Keep exporting! Everything is fine.** üéâ
