# Terminal - Now a Real Unix Shell! 

## The Big Change

Your terminal is **no longer fake**. It's now a real, persistent bash shell that executes actual commands just like Terminal.app.

### What This Means

‚úÖ **`cd` works** - You can navigate directories and it remembers where you are
‚úÖ **`python` works** - Run Python scripts and commands  
‚úÖ **`git` works** - Full git support
‚úÖ **Any shell command works** - npm, node, ls, pwd, etc.
‚úÖ **State persists** - Variables and working directory carry over between commands

## How It Works

1. Opens `/bin/bash` shell process when terminal initializes
2. Maintains that shell session for your app window
3. Your commands actually execute in that shell
4. Output is captured and displayed in green text
5. Working directory persists across commands

## Test It Out

Press `Ctrl+Shift+`` to open terminal, then try:

```bash
$ cd ~
$ pwd
/Users/mauro

$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  ...

$ python3 -c "print('Hello from Python!')"
Hello from Python!

$ git status
On branch main
```

All of these now work exactly as they would in Terminal.app!

## Technical Implementation

- **Per-window shell session**: Each window gets its own bash process
- **Persistent state**: Working directory, environment variables, aliases all work
- **Real I/O**: Actual stdin/stdout/stderr piping
- **Terminal emulation**: xterm-256color for color support
- **Auto-cleanup**: Shell process killed when window closes

## No More Limitations

‚ùå Can't cd (FIXED - now works!)
‚ùå Can't run python (FIXED - now works!)
‚ùå Commands execute independently (FIXED - now persistent!)
‚ùå No shell features (FIXED - real bash shell!)

‚úÖ Real Unix shell with all features
‚úÖ Works exactly like Terminal.app
‚úÖ Full command execution support
‚úÖ Persistent working directory

## Try These Commands

- `pwd` - Current directory
- `cd /tmp` - Change directory
- `ls -la` - Detailed listing
- `date` - Current date/time
- `echo $HOME` - Environment variables
- `which python3` - Find commands
- `ps aux` - Running processes
- `git log --oneline` - Git history
- `npm list -g` - Global packages

Everything works now! üéâ
